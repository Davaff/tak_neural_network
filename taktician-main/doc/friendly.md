# FriendlyBot

Hello, friend! You've reached the home of FriendlyBot, a Tak bot
designed to be a tool to help you learn the game of Tak.

# Playing FriendlyBot

You can play games against FriendlyBot on playtak.com. Log in and find
the bot's name under "Join game". If it's not there, it might be
occupied right now -- it can only play one person at a time right now.

# Changing the difficulty level

FriendlyBot supports playing at a number of different difficulty
levels.

To change the difficulty level, just say

    FriendlyBot: level LEVEL

e.g.

    FriendlyBot: level 6

in chat. It supports a number of levels, from 1 up through 13, at the
moment.

The levels have somewhat different styles of play, in addition to
being harder or easier, so try a few different levels, even if you're
struggling with one.

If you're playing the bot, you can even change the difficulty level
mid-game.

Levels 10 and up are roughly equivalent to Taktician at various stages
of its development, and so should be considered pretty challenging.

At any given time, the highest level will track approximately the
current play of Taktician.

FriendlyBot can also play on different sizes of board. Try, for example:

    FriendlyBot: size 5

# FPABot

`FPABot` is a variant of `FriendlyBot` that exists to test variatons
on the rules or play style to reduce the first-player advantage that
exists in vanilla Tak.

At present, it follows the rule that the first player must place the
second player's initial stone somewhere in the center of the board. It
may be updated with additional variations in the future.

It obeys the same commands a `FriendlyBot`, but under its own name.
